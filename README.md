# Java Backend Development Programs

Welcome to my collection of Java Full Stack Development programs! This repository contains a variety of programs and projects that I've implemented using multiple technologies in the Java ecosystem. 
Feel free to explore the projects and delve into the codebase to gain insights into various Java technologies.

## Technologies Used
- Backend : Java, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, JSTL, Hibernate ORM, Spring Core, Spring Boot, REST-APIs, Microservices
- Databases : MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Developer Tools : Git, Maven, SL4J, Apache Kafka, Redis Cache


## Usage
- Pull the repo and import the projects in your Eclipse IDE, also make sure to include the necessary jar and war files to run the project.
- Open Eclipse IDE and choose a folder to create a workspace. Then follow the below steps to import multiple projects of a chapter in one go
- Make sure to add the required **Jar files** (Mysql connector, Hikaricp etc) in the initial programs of JDBC, JSP, and Hibernate as there is no project management tool used here.

## Follow the steps to import in Eclipse IDE
